<p>
Hello. I am a software engineer who enjoys building things for the internet.  I develop exceptional websites and applications that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with modern, performant backends. I enjoy working with entrepreneurs who are as passionate and competitive about their business as I am about my software.
